# My site
This is part of lab work for a course called COMP1010 at UNSW.

The task was to go through the process of creating and deploying a website involving HTML and CSS to the internet using GitHub Pages.

The HTML and CSS consists of a basic website with a heading and a zoomable map.
It uses some javascript in order to navigate the jpg image of a map from a game called Elden Ring.
